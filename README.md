# R-Heatmap-Files
Here you'll find 2 files necessary to carry out the code
that will allow you to build a very crude heatmap in R.

It's a good starting point for anyone wanting to get their feet wet. 

I have added not only the R script, but a second file that 
is called in the R script, as well. 

This is a for beginners, just to be clear!
